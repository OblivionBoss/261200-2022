2.) Operations
========================
-- RPGcharacter class --
========================
public RPGcharacter(double speed) :
=> Class constructor to assign
   - HP,maxHP,mana,maxMana
   - level,baseSpeed,maxSpeed
   to character with double speed as input
public void levelUp() :
=> operation to level up character and assign new value of
   level,maxHP,maxMana,baseSpeed and maxSpeed with updateSpeed() operation
public void attack(RPGcharacter p) :
=> operation to attack target RPGcharacter p and consists of 3 condition
   - if character has no sword equip : return nothing (can't attack target without sword equipped)
   - if target is equipped with shield : sword damage get lessen by shield defense
   - if target isn't equipped with shield : target received full sword damage
public void equippedSword(Sword sword) :
=> operation to make character equip sword
   and called updateSpeed() operation to update current character's speed
   (send null to unequipped sword)
public void equippedShield(Shield shield){// send null to unequipped shield
=> operation to make character equip shield
   and called updateSpeed() operation to update current character's speed
   (send null to unequipped shield)
private void updateSpeed(){
=> update character speed by determined form baseSpeed,level,Sword,Shield
public void printStat(){
=> show character's current status which consist of
   - Level,Max HP,Max Mana,Max Speed,HP,Mana,Base Speed
   - Sword and Shield equipped

=================
-- Sword class --
=================
public Sword(double damage) :
=> Class constructor to assign
   sword default level (level 0) and damage
   to sword with double damage as input
public void levelUp() :
=> operation to level up sword and assign new value of level and damage
public double getDamage() :
=> operation to return value of referenced sword's damage
public int getLevel() :
=> operation to return value of referenced sword's level
public void printStat() :
=> show sword's current status which consist of Level and Sword Damage

==================
-- Shield class --
==================
public Shield(double defense) :
=> Class constructor to assign
   shield default level (level 0) and defense
   to shield with double defense as input
public void levelUp() :
=> operation to level up shield and assign new value of level and defense
public double getDefense() :
=> operation to return value of referenced shield's defense
public int getLevel() :
=> operation to return value of referenced shield's level
public void printStat() :
=> show shield's current status which consist of Level and Shield Defense

3.) Information Computing
========================
-- RPGcharacter class --
========================
- private int level => level default value is 0 and become more after called operation levelUp()
- private double maxSpeed
  => consist of 2 operations
     -Constructor : (default value)
      => depends on level and baseSpeed [ maxSpeed = baseSpeed*(0.1+0.03*level) ]
     -updateSpeed()
      => Similar to constructor condition
         but also depends on equipped shield and sword
         which reduce character maximum speed
         Equipped Sword : maxSpeed -= baseSpeed*(0.1+0.04*sword.getLevel())
         Equipped Shield : maxSpeed -= baseSpeed*(0.1+0.04*shield.getLevel())
- private double HP
=> default value of HP is 100 but
   can be reduced by calling attack(RPGcharacter p)
- private int maxHP
=> default value of maxHP is 100 but
   can be add by calling levelUp() in
   which depends on level
   [ maxHP = 100+10*level ]
- private int maxMana
=> default value of maxMana is 50 but
   can be add by calling levelUp() in
   which depends on level
   [ maxMana = 50+2*level ]

=================
-- Sword class --
=================
- private int level => level default value is 0 and become more after called operation levelUp()
- private double damage
=> sword's damage can change after calling levelUp()
   which depends on sword's level
   [ damage = damage*(1+0.1*level) ]

==================
-- Shield class --
==================
- private int level => level default value is 0 and become more after called operation levelUp()
- private double defense
=> shield's defense can change after calling levelUp()
   which depends on shield's level
   [ defense = defense*(1+0.05*level) ]
